# Human-Activity-Recognition
•	Human Activity Recognition is the problem of predicting what a person is doing based on a their  movement using sensors. 
•	This projects aims to classify the type of movements from the 6 human activities  WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
•	The database has been built from the recordings of group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
•	Recognition is done by exploiting the information retrieved from Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone which has embedded inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscope for measuring 3-axial linear acceleration and angular velocity respectively at a constant rate of 50Hz, which is sufficient for capturing human body motion.so I have classified using Support Vector Machine [SVM] algorithm.
•	70% - training data - the training set is then used to train a multiclass SVM classifier
•	30%- test data.
•	An overall maximum accuracy of 96% has been obtained for the test data.

The dataset of the problem statement has been taken from the kaggle dataset
